# AASD: An Open Non-Invasive EEG Dataset for Spontaneous Auditory Attention Switch Decoding
A Large-Scale EEG Dataset for Investigating Spontaneous Auditory Attention Switching

## 📚 Introduction

The **Auditory Attention Switching Dataset (AASD)** provides a comprehensive collection of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, specifically designed to study spontaneous auditory attention switching in natural listening environments. This dataset is a significant contribution to the field of auditory brain–computer interfaces (BCI), enabling research on spontaneous attention switch rather than externally cued transitions. With this dataset, you can investigate natural auditory attention mechanisms and support the development of robust neural decoding algorithms for real-world BCI applications.
